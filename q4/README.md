### You can choose to code Recomender System in Python or JAVA
### Allthough only Python version of how to read the dataset and what API needs to be developed is provided. 
### How to read the dataset and API to develope is available in python folder
### Data is available in data folder

- Problem Details
  One needs to build a Top n (n is parameter) User Collaborative recommendation model using any recommendation algorithm of their choice.
  
- Dataset
  - The Data set is taken from [Movie Lens Small](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip).
  - go to [Movie Lens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). to understand more about the data set.
      
- Evaluation
  - Offline Evaluation Metric
      - Its good if you can implement RMSE Accuracy metric for your code
      - Its good if you can implement ARHR (Avarage Reciprocal Hit Rate) on your top N recommendation
      - Use some trick to include novelty and diversity in your recommendation (Top n)
